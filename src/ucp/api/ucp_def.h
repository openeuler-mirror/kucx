/**
 * @ingroup UCP_CONTEXT
 * @brief UCP Application Context
 *
 * UCP application context (or just a context) is an opaque handle that holds a
 * UCP communication instanceâ€™s global information.  It represents a single UCP
 * communication instance.  The communication instance could be an OS process
 * (an application) that uses UCP library.  This global information includes
 * communication resources, endpoints, memory, temporary file storage, and
 * other communication information directly associated with a specific UCP
 * instance.  The context also acts as an isolation mechanism, allowing
 * resources associated with the context to manage multiple concurrent
 * communication instances. For example, users using both MPI and OpenSHMEM
 * sessions simultaneously can isolate their communication by allocating and
 * using separate contexts for each of them. Alternatively, users can share the
 * communication resources (memory, network resource context, etc.) between
 * them by using the same application context. A message sent or a RMA
 * operation performed in one application context cannot be received in any
 * other application context.

 *
 * The endpoint handle is an opaque object that is used to address a remote
 * @ref ucp_worker_h "worker". It typically provides a description of source,
 * destination, or both. All UCP communication routines address a destination
 * with the endpoint handle. The endpoint handle is associated with only one
 * @ref ucp_context_h "UPC context". UCP provides the @ref ucp_ep_create
 * "endpoint create" routine to create the endpoint handle and the @ref
 * ucp_ep_destroy "destroy" routine to destroy the endpoint handle.

 *
 * UCP worker is an opaque object representing the communication context.  The
 * worker represents an instance of a local communication resource and progress
 * engine associated with it. Progress engine is a construct that is
 * responsible for asynchronous and independent progress of communication
 * directives. The progress engine could be implement in hardware or software.
 * The worker object abstract an instance of network resources such as a host
 * channel adapter port, network interface, or multiple resources such as
 * multiple network interfaces or communication ports. It could also represent
 * virtual communication resources that are defined across multiple devices.
 * Although the worker can represent multiple network resources, it is
 * associated with a single @ref ucp_context "UCX application context".
 * All communication functions require a context to perform the operation on
 * the dedicated hardware resource(s) and an @ref ucp_ep_h "endpoint" to address the
 * destination.
 *
 * @note Worker are parallel "threading points" that an upper layer may use to
 * optimize concurrent communications.
